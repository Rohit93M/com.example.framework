# Trello Web Application Testing Framework

## Project Overview
This project is a Java Maven TestNG framework designed for practice automation testing using the Trello web application. Trello is a project management tool that helps teams organize tasks and projects using boards, lists, and cards.

## Key Features
- *Board Customization Testing*: Ensure end-to-end board creation and deletion is working fine.
- *Trello Login* : Check Trello account login feature is working fine
- *Task Creation Testing*: Validate functionality related to creating lists and cards on Trello boards.
- *Integration with TestNG*: Utilize TestNG for structured and efficient testing of Trello functionalities.

## Along with that I have added testing files for google search page, facebook sign up page, facebook login page and a sample form for further practice which will be of great help. 
Note: The form html file is there in the src/test/resources folder.
